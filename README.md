Make PDFs Learnable is a web application that allows you to cut out specific parts of a PDF and paste them at the end. This tool is perfect for learning, as it helps you hide information in a PDF document, allowing you to test your knowledge and check the solutions once you're done.

## Features

- **Cut and Paste**: Easily select and cut parts of your PDF, which are then automatically pasted at the end.
- **Solution Checking**: Your answers or solutions are hidden until you feel ready to check your work; simply scroll to the end.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for simplicity and ease of use, making learning more effective.
- **Download**: Once you are done with redacting learnable information, you can download the PDF to use it wherever you want.
